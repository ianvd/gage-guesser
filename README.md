# **Gage Guesser**

Theo Ross and Ian Van Dusen

Estimating discharge in hydrosheds. We will look at different gages downstream of glaciers and collect shapefiles around their watersheds boundaries. We will retrieve climate data for each area and display influences of different climate metrics on discharge levels. Finally, we will train a machine learning model to predict discharge levels for different months at the gage sites.
